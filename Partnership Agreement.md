1. Name of Partnership  
    1. All 3 of our names and addresses  
    2. DBA information  
        1. Creativo?  
        2. Future DBA's? Can we leave it open for them? What's the best approach  
   

2. Business Purpose  
    1. e.g. "To develop and market internet-based products, particularly "web applications", with the goal of improving our users' lives."  
   
3. Capital Contribution  
    1. What we know: We have no capital contributed so far  
    2. Questions: What are possible future cap ex? How do we fund them? What happens to the other sections of this agreement when we include capital?  Possible Areas:  
        1. Personal Property. We have personal property involved in the business. Mainly our computers. Do they become property of the business? If we want to write equipment off as an expense how do we handle that?  
        2. House/Office. We would like to move in together and set up office in a basement. Johnnie's parents may be willing to finance the lease on a house. Does this get factored into the business? Would this become the HQ address that gets listed at the top of the agreement? Need legal advice on this.  
        3. Client List. No one is bringing clients.  
        4. IP. Is T bringing code into the business? Is it owned by the business? Can other partners modify it?  
    

4. Salaries/Distributions   
    1. Distribution Structure:  
        1. Evenly. Being 33/33/33 is a lot better than 50/50 because we can't have head to head stalemates.   
        2. Other. Many arguments for this. Can see T taking higher % because we are relying so heavily on his skills.   

    2. Do we plan on reinvesting profits or taking salary?

    4. How will losses be handled?

    4. Handle the Finances   
        1. Collect from customers, pay vendors/employees, and keep track of the money.

1. Intellectual Property   
    1. We will decide what happens to the IP once our company creates it. One of these ways:  
        1. Someone gets all the digital assets and we wish them well   
        2. We will each get the chance to offer to buy the others out
